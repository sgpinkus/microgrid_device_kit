class GDevice(Device):
  ''' Simple generator device. Strictly produces power. Cost of power is specified by an arbitrary
  polynomial.

  GDevice takes a single parameter `cost`, which defines the coefficients of the polynomial at each
  timeslot. `cost` can be a single array of coeffs or an array of len(self) arrays of coeffs (one for
  each timeslot). Thermal generators generally have quadratic cost curves.

  Generation is always indicated by negative values. However the cost function provided should define
  *positive* costs over a *positive* range. Example [1,1,0] for cost(q) = q**2 + q

  Time variable max generation capacity is specified by setting `lbounds`. GDevice enforces that
  hbounds must be <=0 for this device (can never consume).

  Cost function for all timeslots are independent. Start up / shut down and min/max runtimes are not
  considered.

  Note for generators "utility" is interpreted as profit (which is revenue - cost)
